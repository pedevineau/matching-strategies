# matching-strategies

Demonstrator of some affectation processes to maximize satisfaction of candidates and of (non-)selective organisms.

## What the repository consists of

It consists of basic demonstrators for matching algorithms. They use external libraries or implement some basic functions from scratch.
So far the demonstrators address the Hungarian algorithm and the Gale-Shapley algorithm.

This repository is not a ready-to-deploy packaged library.

## How to contribute

If you implement some matching algorithms, don't hesistate to pull requests.

If you know open source implementations of matching algorithms,
